# random-projects

Just a couple of random projects I've worked on personally or for school

### AstarDemo
School project demonstrating the A-star algortihm on a predetrmined grid maze

### MathDrills
A small program I made for my younger sister to practice quick addition and subtraction
(she wasn't interested in this but i was)

### RoleShuffle
Quick code i did for a roleplay we were supposed to do where we couldn't decide on who plays which role.

### TriAlgoSearch and TriAlgoSearch+UI
School project. The program was supposed to demonstrate the BFS, DFS, and DLS algorithms. Added UI for visual presentation of travel.

### censorship
a codechef practice problem. vowels were censored (asterisk were put instead) in sentences and with the provided letters they were to be uncensored.
ex. "H*w *r* y**?" "oaeou"

### dfsUserInput
School project. Implement DFS algorithm on a user provided graph.

### dlsPresetGraph
personal test for the code that follows this. wanted to test out if my dfs algorithm was working well already

### dlsUserInput
School project. Implement DLS algorithm on a user provided graph.

### taskshuffler
Quick code i did when i wasn't sure what to do with my free time. simple random choice from list of tasks.
